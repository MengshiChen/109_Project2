  <p><b>In this website, visitors play a puzzle game, the pieces of the puzzle are randomly placed and disrupted, and visitors need to find the corresponding pieces from these pieces, and then move the pieces to the blue box to form a complete picture. When you're done, the page will say you got this at the bottom. Soft music plays in the background, and sound effects appear when moving pieces. This website emulated puzzles we played in childhood. Due to the development of the Internet, now children are lack of physical childhood, is no longer in reality with partners to meet and play. Today's kids' childhood is filled with cold machine games. I hope this website will not only help adults regain the happiness of childhood, but also let children experience the happiness of physical games.
